-- minerva — multi-monitor desktop (NVIDIA). Ported from minerva.conf.
--
-- Monitors on this machine can disconnect/reconnect at runtime; explicit
-- monitor rules make Hyprland restore the same layout on every replug
-- instead of auto-placing.
--
-- Layout (origin top-left, pixels — all POSITIONS ARE LOGICAL, i.e. after
-- transform AND scale):
--   - HDMI-A-3: XEC ES-G34C8, a 34" 3440x1440 ULTRAWIDE, physically
--     mounted PORTRAIT, so transform 1 (90° left). Unscaled: logical
--     1440x3440.
--   - DP-5 / DP-4: two Dell S2719DGF (2560x1440) stacked vertically to
--     the right of it, DP-5 on top, DP-4 directly below.
--
-- CRITICAL — HDMI-A-3 IS 3440x1440, NOT 4K. It advertises a 3840x2160 mode
-- and will happily accept it, then rescale the signal onto its real
-- 3440x1440 grid. Nothing errors; the picture just comes out squashed,
-- because 3840x2160 on an 800x330mm (21:9) panel gives pixels 36% taller
-- than wide. The EDID physical size and its preferred mode both say
-- ultrawide — believe them over the box the monitor came in.
--
-- CRITICAL — WRITE THE MODE LANDSCAPE-FIRST (3440x1440), NOT 1440x3440.
-- Hyprland applies `transform` itself; the mode string must name a real EDID
-- mode, and the panel never advertises a portrait one. Put the portrait
-- numbers there and the lookup fails, Hyprland falls back silently, and you
-- get 1920x1080 upscaled. Verified behaviour, not a guess — the two easiest
-- ways to break this file are both above.
--
-- The Dells sit at x=1440 because that is HDMI-A-3's LOGICAL right edge:
-- 1440 is the ROTATED width (the mode's 1440 becomes the horizontal axis),
-- divided by scale 1. Their left edge must match exactly or the cursor (and
-- new windows) can't cross the gap onto them — keyboard nav still works,
-- which makes it look like the Dells are "dead". Change the HDMI scale and
-- you must move the Dells: 1.25 -> x=1152, 1.5 -> x=960.
--
-- The portrait panel (3440 logical tall) is TALLER than the 2880-tall Dell
-- stack, so the Dells are centered against IT, not the reverse:
-- (3440 - 2880) / 2 = 280, hence DP-5 at y=280 and DP-4 at y=1720.
--
-- The Dells are 1440p, NOT 4K — do not put 3840x2160 back here (that was a
-- stale mode that fell back to preferred and left a vertical gap). DP-5 runs
-- 144Hz; DP-4 currently maxes at 60Hz (cable/port limited — a proper DP
-- cable would unlock 144 there too).
--
-- When DP-4/DP-5 drop away, Hyprland automatically migrates every workspace
-- to the remaining monitor (HDMI-A-3) — it becomes the de-facto primary with
-- no extra config. On reconnect the rules below put everything back in this
-- exact orientation.
--
-- NVIDIA driver/connector changes may renumber outputs — if the layout comes
-- up scrambled, run `hyprctl monitors` and fix the names.
--
-- transform 1 = 90° (portrait, rotated left)

-- 165Hz caused intermittent signal loss over this HDMI connection.
-- Keep 60Hz for stable operation.
